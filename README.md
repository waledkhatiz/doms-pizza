# doms-pizza #
A basic pizza ordering app made with Java and Swing.

Used to demonstrate proficiency using object-oriented languages and 
UI tools like swing. 

## Running and Compiling:\
>    cd doms-pizza\
>    javac menu.java\
>    java menu

## Progress:\
-pizza.java is just a pre-written pizza object that I havent implemented into the main code yet.\
-currently just a layout of the basic UI and functionalities.
